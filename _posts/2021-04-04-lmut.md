Read [this post at Medium](https://vishnudsharma.medium.com/explaining-deep-reinforcement-learning-models-with-linear-model-u-trees-64c7d788fe4f). <br />
A popular deep learning explainability approach is to approaximate the behavior of the pre-trained deep learning model into a less complex, but interpretable learning method. 
Decision trees are quite useful here because they are often easy to interpret, while also providing a good performance. In this post, I summarise a explanability method using 
Linear Model U-Trees (LMUTs) by *Guiliang Liu*, *Oliver Schulte*, *Wang Zhu* and *Qingcan Li* in their paper *Toward Interpretable Deep Reinforcement Learning with Linear Model U-Trees*.
