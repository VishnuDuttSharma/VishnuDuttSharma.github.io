Neural Networks (NNs) are the basic units of deep learning model. Therefore, the first step towards understanding how deep learning models work is to understand how NNs work. In this post, I use a methoematical approach using plots and matrix algebra to shed light on how the elements of NN come together to generate a powerful learning mechanism.
