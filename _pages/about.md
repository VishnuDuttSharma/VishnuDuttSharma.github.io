I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), advised by Dr. Pratap Tokekar. My research interests lie in the learning algorithms, deep learning in particular, and their applications in robotics perception and planning. 

I completed my MTech and BTech in 2017 from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, specializing in Visual Information and Embedded Systems. I also earned a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. At IIT Kharagpur, I conducted research with [Dr. Amrith Krishna](https://krishnamrith12.github.io/) and [Dr. Pawan Goyal](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/) in word segmentation and poetry-to-prose conversion for Sanskrit. 
Before joining the PhD program, I worked for two years at American Express India with the Machine Learning and Data Science Team to build and leverage deep learning for credit and fraud risk management. 

This summer I interned with [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/), working on local planning problems with my mentors [Dr. Matthew Andrews](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/matthewandrews/) and [Jeongran Lee](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/jeongranlee/). 
Previous summer I was supported by [Kulkarni Foundation Summer Research Fellowship](https://www.gradschool.umd.edu/funding/student-fellowships-awards/kulkarni-foundation-summer-research-fellowship) for research work at UMD. In the summer 2021, I interned at [Comcast](https://corporate.comcast.com/) with the Applied AI for CX team on improving the maintenance truck scheduling with learning techniques. Prior to joining the PhD program, I have interned with American Express in 2015 with the Commerce Data Science team and with [FlytBase Labs (formerly *NavStik Labs*)](https://flytbase.com/) in 2016.
