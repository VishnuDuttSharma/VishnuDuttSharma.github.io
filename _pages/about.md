I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), advised by Dr. Pratap Tokekar. My research interests lie in the learning algorithms, deep learning in particular, their applications in robotics (perception and planning), and interpretable decision-making. 

I completed my MTech and BTech in 2017 from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, specializing in Visual Information and Embedded Systems. I also earned a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. At IIT Kharagpur, I conducted research with [Dr. Amrith Krishna](https://krishnamrith12.github.io/) and [Dr. Pawan Goyal](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/) in word segmentation and poetry-to-prose conversion for Sanskrit. 
Before joining the PhD program, I worked for two years at American Express India with the Machine Learning and Data Science Team to build and leverage deep learning for credit and fraud risk management. 

This summer I interned at [Comcast](https://corporate.comcast.com/) with the Applied AI team on improving the maintenance truck scheduling with learning techniques. In past I have interned with American Express in 2015 with the Commerce Data Science team and with [FlytBase Labs (formerly *NavStik Labs*)](https://flytbase.com/) in 2016.
